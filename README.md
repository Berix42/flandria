# Flandria
![](/webapp/static/assets/logo.png?raw=True)


Starting 01.01.2022, I stopped working on Flandria and took the website down.

If you're considering hosting the website yourself, please remove my personal about page and donation links before publishing.
Please be wary, that I did not update any security over the years, so it is probably not safe to use as it is.
There's also no documentation on how to do things and I won't provide any support or help.
